Westchester offers numerous volunteering opportunities ranging from the environment, education, community development or whatever you’re interested in. Most volunteering organizations are filled with high school students. However, often students volunteer just for the sake of college application, but they don’t realize the rewarding feeling that they get after putting such great effort into a good cause. Volunteering is an extremely beneficial activity that not only leaves you feeling gratified, but you are lifting the burden off many people’s shoulders. I recommend starting your volunteering journey by researching local organizations that align with your interests and values. Since Westchester is home to a diverse range of nonprofits, schools, food pantries, animal shelters, etc, looking for the right volunteering organization may be difficult. That’s why I created this guide and list of places you can volunteer to help narrow your choices.
