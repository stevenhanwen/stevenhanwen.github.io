<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->

Both the US women’s and men’s soccer national teams have made significant progress in recent decades: World Cup qualifiers, Olympic titles, Concacaf Cup, you name it. It is fair to say the United States has proven itself as a competitive soccer team internationally. As a result, parents are eager to send their children to any soccer camps, not only for the benefits of outdoor activities but also for the development of collaboration, skills, and leadership.
However, with so many youth soccer clubs in town, sometimes it's hard to decide which one to enroll in. I am a high school student playing both high school and club in Westchester. I'd like to share with you a list of the best youth soccer clubs that you can join. 

Youth soccer clubs are different.
Some soccer clubs offer soccer camps for k-8 grade kids just for leisure as after-school activities, while others are serious about installing a systematic training program for young players who aim at joining their high school varsity team or even playing at the collegiate level. I was such a kid when I was 11 years old.

In order to play at the highest level and possibly reach the collegiate level, it is crucial to climb up the soccer pyramid. The soccer pyramid essentially divides clubs based on the quality of the leagues they participate in. MLS Next is the highest level and below that there is a second tier—the National Academy League and ECNL. Regional leagues make up the third/fourth tier. These teams compete at a local level within just a within a county (e.g., WYSL) or state ("NYCSL")

Throughout my youth career, I wanted to play at a better club each year because I knew it would make me a better player, and competing against better players brought me joy. At the age of twelve, I joined my first team playing in the Westchester Youth Soccer League—frankly one of the lowest levels you can play, but a great starting point. Since then, I have climbed up the soccer pyramid, participating in EDP, USYS National League, and now the National Academy League. In between switching teams, I spent countless hours of tedious research to find out which club would challenge me as a player and also accommodate financial needs.

The table below lists some of the best clubs in Westchester based on various factors including the quality of coaches, difficulty to make the team, and costs. These factors are critical to the development of a player and considered by parents. Good coaches teach players to pay attention to the details, which otherwise are often missed out in the game.. Teams participating in higher-level leagues are harder to be on. Not to mention, it would be out of reach for a player to jump directly from WYSL to MLS Next. Cost is also something that many people forget about. It is unrealistic for a player to join a team that will cost a fortune given their financial situation. Since parents and players have to consider all these factors, this list makes finding a new team in Westchester ten times easier. Let’s break down the table.

- **Club name**: Name of club
- **Age**: Many local clubs only offer spots on teams that go from ages 7-14. This will exclude players in high school. These clubs are usually called town clubs that most likely participate in WYSL or EDP. It is okay to be on a team that only has non-high school aged teams, but players should make sure to find a club once they are in high school. 
Boys, girls, or both: almost all clubs accept both boys and girls, but the team might not be available for a certain age. For example, Eastern FC doesn’t have a girl team under 10.
- **Practice field**: Where a team practices is an important factor parents need to consider. it imposes a dramatic burden on parents if they have to take their child to practice an hour away three times a week. Therefore, we need to consider the location of a club and whether you make a commitment to the team to attend all training sessions. 
- **Cost**: Playing for a club team is not cheap. At the minimum, a club can cost around $2500. For the list below club costs are labeled high, medium, and low. They are determined based on the following. 

  - Fee >= 4k, cost is **high**
  - Fee 2.5k < f < 4k, cost is **medium**
  - Fee <= 2.5k, cost is **low**
